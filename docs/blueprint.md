## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep mustard (#D4A017) evokes a sense of tradition and warmth, grounding the user experience.
- Background color: A very light desaturated mustard tone (#F7F4E5). The hue is taken directly from the primary, providing visual coherence; a light scheme has been chosen to keep the layout clear and contemporary.
- Accent color: Army green (#4B5320). Green sits approximately 30 degrees to the 'left' of yellow on the color wheel; and this deeply saturated dark color stands in marked contrast to the brightness of the background and primary.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern yet slightly warm feel that is suitable for an app managing shopping lists.
- Use Material Design icons for consistency.
- Clean and minimal Android Material Design UI with consistent spacing.
- Subtle transitions and animations for feedback on interactions.
